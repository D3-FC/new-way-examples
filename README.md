# GET STARTED

Hello, Inquiring minds!
This project aims to search the best new way how to implement modern SPAs.

## How to work
--

We are going to search the best way of developing apps in practice.

So when you have some idea for future project, 
just create the folder with the project name like this:
`MyProject.implementations.ActiceRecordPattern`

If someone has already created the project you want work with,
 just go inside it and create your own implementations 
`MyProject.implementations.ActiceRecordPattern`


All code should be written in TS syntax in `.ts` files.

We are not going create here tools, we are going just show in examples 
how do we want to see our future projects. 
So you should use Abstract non existing libs to develop your app. 

you can see example in `FirstApo` folder
